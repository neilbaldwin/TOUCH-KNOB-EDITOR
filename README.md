# TOUCH-KNOB-EDITOR
An editor in Touch OSC for creating modular-style knobs that you can use in your own Touch OSC projects.

## A What?!

As a continuation of my ![Touch Knobs](https://github.com/neilbaldwin/TOUCH-KNOBS) project and prompted by a fellow Touch OSC obsessive, I created a visual editor in Touch OSC that lets you design custom modular-style knobs easily and quickly. Once you've created a masterpiece you can go back into Edit mode in Touch OSC and copy-and-paste the knob into your own projects. Once created they exist and function as a standalone object. You can also add messages to them (OSC, MIDI, local) like other objects.

## When you say "custom" what can you customise?

* Diameter
* Height
* Pointer diameter
* Pointer length
* Outline (stroke)
* Drop shadow
* Color (hue, saturation and lightness) of knob, pointer and outline
* Shadow brightness
* Control orientation (drag in X axis, Y axis or rotational axis)
* Control response (speed/precision when dragging to change value)
* Left or right-handed UI (editor option)

## How do I get it?

Just download the .tosc file, TOUCH-KNOB-EDITOR.tosc, open it in Touch OSC.
