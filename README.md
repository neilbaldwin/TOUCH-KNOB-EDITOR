# TOUCH-KNOB-EDITOR
An editor in Touch OSC for creating modular-style knobs that you can use in your own Touch OSC projects.

## A What?!

As a continuation of the Touch Knobs project and prompted by a fellow Touch OSC obsessive, I created a visual editor in Touch OSC that lets you design custom modular-style knobs easily and quickly. Once you've created a masterpiece you can go back into Edit mode in Touch OSC and copy-and-paste the knob into your own projects. Once created they exist and function as a standalone object. You can also add messages to them (OSC, MIDI, local) like other objects.
